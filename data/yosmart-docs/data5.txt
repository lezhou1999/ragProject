Authentication Credentials in YoSmart API

There are two main types of authentication credentials used in the YoSmart API: CSID and UAC.

1. CSID (Customer Service ID)

CSID is an authentication credential issued by YoSmart to its business partners. It is used for mass access and control of YoSmart devices. Business partners can use CSID to manage a large number of devices, including requesting access to devices from other users.

- CSID: Unique identifier for the customer
- CSSecKey: Secret key associated with the CSID

To obtain a CSID, business users must contact YoSmart through the appropriate channel.

2. UAC (User Access Credential)

UAC is an access credential created by individual users in the YoLink app. It is used to authorize third-party applications to access the user's account and associated devices. UAC is suitable for personal use and small-scale access.

- UAID: Unique ID of the UAC
- Secret Key: Secret key associated with the UAC

Both CSID and UAC are used to request access tokens, which are then used to authorize API requests.
